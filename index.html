            As a passionate clean energy enthusiast and environmental advocate, I have utilized my skills and abilities
            to educate consumers about the economic and environmental benefits of going solar. I've been at my best in
            situations that require exponential growth....as the first marketing executive of a community solar
            developer startup, helping lead the company to #192 on the Inc. 5000 list of fastest growing companies.
            Founding an online solar customer acquisition company that built two of the most successful, respected
            customer acquisition websites in the solar industry, with over 2,000,000 unique visitors each year. Starting
            a digital marketing agency focused on solar customer acquisition that has generated over 1,000,000 leads and
            resulted in tens of thousands of solar installations.
          </p>

          <p class="lato">
            In 2020, I decided to utilize these skills and abilities to tackle a new challenge in the clean energy
            industry...helping the industry build a superior workforce, designed to tackle all of our industry's growth
            challenges, so that we can create a cleaner planet for generations to come. Over the coming years and
            decades, we're going to attract millions of new professionals to our industry and partner with degree
            programs, continuing education programs, skills development programs, and more to help promote personal and
            professional growth within our industry.
          </p>

          <p class="lato">
            Clean Energy Social is the clean energy professional network. Companies will be able to promote their
            mission and culture, and professionals will be able to research companies, apply for their open positions,
            discover education opportunities, and network with other clean energy professionals. We're excited to
            feature the best companies and professionals in solar, wind, hydro, energy storage, energy efficiency,
            vehicles, bio-fuels, corporate sustainability, and more.
          </p>

          <p class="lato">
            Ten years ago, I wanted nothing more than to join the clean energy industry. It almost didn’t happen for me.
            There were no resources for clean energy job opportunities and I had no idea where to start. I don’t feel a
            lot has changed in that regard since then, and I’ve been left to wonder about how many great candidates our
            industry has lost as a result. With Clean Energy Social, we’re going to make sure we change that.
